            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HOw now brother of Spaine? how run the Cheating dice of this unconſtant world?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Spaine.</speaker>
               <p>Sometimes fives, ſometimes ſevens, ſometimes nines, all upon odde numbers; but if you will but give me the hearing of it, I will tell you ſuch a ſacke full of newes from England that will make you laugh, hold buttons hold.</p>

               <p>Prethee be briefe, I long to heare the news.</p>

               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Then thus; There is a thing held there at this time which is call'd a Parliament, in which as it ſeems they uſe to chide offenders: now there was ſome which favour'd our religion ſomewhat more then others, and faith for feare of chiding they are runne for't, and lie now ſome under the Court of thy wings, and ſome under mine; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, (for they are) a many of them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſome are ſo puft up with pride that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty hath got the upper hand, the Coblers and Weavers, Sowgelders and Tinkers, Chimney-ſweepers and Butchers, doe not ſticke to ſay but
<pb facs="tcp:171246:3"/>that the ſpirit moves them to preach; nay they doe, doe it as jealouſly as our ancient ſex hath done at Amſterdam over a hotchpotch.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Faith this news makes me ſmile indeed; but prethee tel me, haſt thou not ſome armado intended againſt that little Iland, that Temple of delight, that Paradiſe in compariſon of all the world again? hath the Jeſuits no braines left to invent a ſecond powder-plot, or one as bad or elſe worſe? doth the Dragon alwaies wake that keepes theſe golden apples the tree of Minerva?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Yes they have braines enough, and courage enough in ſetting ſuch plots a foote, but a pox on't it takes no effect, for one had as good ſhoot arrowes at the ſtars and have a crackt coxcombe for ones labour, as any waies medle with them, for God doth overlooke them and keepe them ſafe, elſe could they never have ſcapt all thoſe plots which I and mine had laid for them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſure they are as wicked as any Nation under the Sunne, how then ſhould God be ſaid to protect them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>For the love he beares to ſome, for there are very honeſt meaning men amongſt them, which doe make a conſcience of their waies, which thing is moſt acceptable of any thing in the ſight of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>But in faith now were the time whilſt the Scots are intrenched and their ſubjects diſtracted, ſome on this ſide, ſome on that ſide, to come with ſome armado, or forward ſome gunpowder plot,
<pb facs="tcp:171246:3"/>or ſome ſuch grand treaſon. Oh the fruition of that ſame little ſweet garden plot would make <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> flouriſh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Harke a while, and you will ſoone grant how ridiculous this childiſh folly of yours is; a wiſe man will never attempt impoſſibilities, for certainly it is as eaſie for any ſingle arme to equall a whole troope of men, as for you or I to effect our wiſhes in this thing: for certainly they have borrowed from Jupiter the heathen God, Argus with his hundred eies to overlooke all our actions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Tuſh, tuſh, thou art juſt like a coward, who if he be once beaten will hardly come on to the combate againe; becauſe your invincible armado (as you tearmed it) was bumbaſted by the ſubjects a maiden Queene, therefore it is impoſſible for us to doe any good upon the ſame land; come thou talkſt idly for want of ſleepe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Why brother of <hi>France,</hi> did you never feele the force of England, looke you but backe to the blacke Prince where you ſhall finde that the then predeceſſor ſent him a tunne of tennis balls inſteed of his right he held by the Salique Law, but hee turned his balls into gunſtones, and kept ſuch a racket about <hi>France</hi> that hee made the whole Court of Gallia ſhake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I doe not deny but that we have both ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted enough, and that is the reaſon I am ſo willing to take an advantage againſt it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I tell thee what brother, I can compare England more commodiouſly to nothing then to a Lion which lay ſleeping by the way ſide, a
<pb facs="tcp:171246:4"/>travellor comming by, would needs make ſport with the Lyon, as he ſaid, by hollowing in his eare to awake him, which he did; the Lyon being not uſed to ſuch unaccuſtomed noiſe, roſe, nor quite awakt, and rore this travellor in peeces. Juſt thus it fareth with us at this time, for England is aſleep, and unleſſe it be awaked, we need not to feare any thing, but if we compell it to draw its ſword once, tis not all our intreaties will ſheath it againe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Well, thou haſt given me ſuch an Item that I will looke before Ile leape, Ile ſurely have ſome great occaſion before I will meddle with them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Faith we have buſineſſe enough of our owne if we would but looke after it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>True, yet I thanke God I am at peace with the whole world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>I would that I could ſay ſo too, for I proteſt ingeniouſly I can ſcarce tell which way to turn my ſelfe, for on one ſide of me the great Turke lies like ſome unſeene monſter, devouring all which ſhall come before him; on the other ſide the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander is as a Divell to me, for I cannot have a ſhip on the ſeas, but if eſpyed by him he is ſure to ſinke for it. And againe, I looke every day when the Portugalls will faſten on me, and above all things I feare them becauſe they have beene for men in England.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Why, I prethee whither wilt thou flye in this diſtreſſe?</p>

               <p>I know not whither, unleſſe I ſhall doe as the foole ſaid he would, put on a cleane ſhirt and drowne my ſelfe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Then what will become of thy ſoule?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Sheh, Ile have a pardon from the Pope before I do it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>That was well thought on indeed, but hearke I prethee, what doſt thou thinke of the Pope his imperious government? doſt thou thinke it to be lawfull according to the heſts of God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>Faith I cannot tell, but I had a little pitty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction roſe the other day in my ſtomacke towards the Proteſtants, but they were preſently downe againe, I hope it is the right way.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>I hope ſo too, for if we be not, I proteſt wee are in the wrong way, and a wrong will leads us to a wrong place &amp; that wrong place wil not yeeld us halfe the delight we expect, wherefore it behoves us to take heed what we doe, and for all the poxe look to our ſelves.</p>

But brother farewell, the newes you heare I pray informe me of.</p>
